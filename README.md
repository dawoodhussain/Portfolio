# [Portfolio](https://dawood.netlify.app/)
  The best way to showcase your skills and work to the world is by having your own Portfolio.
  Once you have developed 2 or more projects, It's the right time to create your portfolio.
  You can also design it using some website builder sites easily. But Yeah, Me being a **Frontend Web Developer**, I have utilized my skills (HTML, CSS/BootStrap, JavaScript) to     design this responsive Portfolio.

#### Here is the approach I have taken & resources from the internet

---

##### 1. How your portfolio should look?
I went through many other web developer portfolios to get some inspiration and planned what my site should look like. <br />
Some resources to checkout portfolios for inspiration: <br />

##### 2. Color Selection
Once you have the design in your mind, Next step is to select a color palette. <br />
There are wide range of color palettes available over the internet for free. you can choose any one among them.. <br />
However, I took a different approach. SELECTED 1 color (Tan-brown `#D2B48C`) at first and used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to generate nice color palettes. And           finally, selected this Discreet color Palette `#D2B48C #BD871F #FFF8F0 #402E32` from the generated ones. <br />

##### 3. Animations
Animations that you see on this portfolio were learnt and re-created based on [Online-Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers) youtube channel. <br />
This is one of the best channel for a front end developer. <br />
    
    > Learnt CSS Animations, Graident Texts, SVG creations & many more..

##### 4. Responsiveness
I always use this site [Am-I-Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) while developing a responsive website.. <br />
I'll also use Live-Server from VS code to test website on real mobiles & Tablets. <br />
