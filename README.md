# [Portfolio](https://dawood.netlify.app/)
  The best way to showcase your skills and work to the world is by having your own Portfolio.
  Once you have developed 2 or more projects, It's the right time to create your portfolio.
  You can also design it using some website builder sites easily. But Yeah, Me being a **Frontend Web Developer**, I have utilized my skills (HTML, CSS/BootStrap, JavaScript) to     design this responsive Portfolio.

#### Here is the approach I have taken & resources from the internet

##### 1. How your portfolio should look?
I went through many other web developer portfolios to get some inspiration and planned what my site should look like. <br />
Some resources to checkout portfolios for inspiration:_

##### 2. Color Selection
    Once you have the design in your mind, Next step is to select a color palette.
    There are wide range of color palettes available over the internet for free. you can choose any one among them..
    However, I took a different approach. SELECTED 1 color (Tan-brown `#D2B48C`) at first and used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to generate nice color palettes. And           finally, selected this Discreet color Palette `#D2B48C #BD871F #FFF8F0 #402E32` from the generated ones.
    Some resources for color palettes:

##### 3. Animations
    Animations that you see on this portfolio were learnt and re-created based on (Online Tutorials)[https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers] youtube channel. 
    This is one of the best channel for a front end developer.
    > Learnt CSS Animations, Graident Texts, SVG creations & many more..

##### 4. Responsiveness
    I always use this site [Am-I-Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) while developing a responsive website..
    I'll also use Live-Server from VS code to test website on real mobiles & Tablets.

###### Finally, Please note this site is still being developed and improved over time..
